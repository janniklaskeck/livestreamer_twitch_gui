livestreamer_twitch_gui
=======================
GUI for the livestreamer application (http://livestreamer.tanuki.se/)
Uses Gson from https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/

Currently only works under Windows

I wrote this, because all of the GUI for livestreamer did not do what i wanted, at least back then.

Many parts of this are poorly written and probably not commented.
I originally got the contents of Twitch_API.java from some forum i can't remember, 
but i had to rewrite it, after justin.tv was closed.

If you find any errors or have (reasonable) suggestions, please let me know
